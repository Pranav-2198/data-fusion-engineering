# Analyzing the Impact of Weather, Traffic, and Taxi Usage on Road Safety in NYC

## Business Problem:
Understanding the dynamics of road safety in New York City is crucial for implementing effective traffic management strategies and ensuring public safety. By examining the interplay between weather conditions, traffic patterns, and taxi usage, stakeholders can gain insights into the factors influencing road safety incidents and potentially mitigate risks associated with adverse conditions.

## Project Description:
* This project aims to design a comprehensive data system that integrates multiple datasets to analyze the relationship between weather, traffic, taxi usage, and road safety in NYC. 
* The datasets utilized include DOT Traffic Speeds, Motor Vehicle Collisions (Persons), Motor Vehicle Collisions (Vehicles), weather data from OpenWeatherMap API, and TLC trip data from the NYC TLC Trip Records. 
* By merging these datasets, we seek to investigate how various weather conditions, traffic densities, and taxi activities impact road safety metrics such as the frequency and severity of motor vehicle collisions. 
* Through rigorous data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential causal relationships.

## Data Analysis:
- **Traffic Congestion Analysis**: 
  - Utilize taxi trip data to identify areas with the highest congestion during different weather conditions and times of day. 
  - Analyze how traffic speeds correlate with the volume of taxi trips and the severity of collisions.
- **Driver Behavior and Road Safety**: 
  - Uncover how weather conditions influence taxi driver behavior and its impact on road safety and correlate them with collision data.
- **Impact of Inclement Weather on Taxi Demand**: 
  - Examine how changes in weather conditions affect taxi demand across different parts of NYC. 
  - Analyze whether there's a correlation between precipitation, temperature, and the frequency of taxi trips.
- **Route Optimization and Traffic Predictions**: 
  - Develop predictive models to forecast future traffic congestion based on weather forecasts and historical taxi patterns.
